1. This is a simple Windows project to add to my portfolio.
   This is an aspect of programming I have been interested in since I first start programming.
   I haven't yet had the chance to experiment with the Win32 API until now. I must also note that
   this aspect of programming is more than likely loosley taught and In my case never even brought
   up in the educational spectrum of programming. This is ashame since graphical programming is an
   aspect I was excited for since the start of my CS journey. I will TRY not to use and IDE for this project.
   Simply Emacs and the compiler. I _NEVER_ use stackoverflow and will use pure documentation and GitHub
   feedback for this project. This is the start...day one...wish me luck! :)

2. A couple of hours has passed and I have switched computers, thus I have updated via 2nd commit a way
   for the github to recognize Emacs anywhere as long as you use "subst z:  Path/To/Emacs/Folder"
   It must be the folder since the path looks in the bin section!!

3. A few more hours has passed and it appears that right now it is impossible for me to avoid Visual
   Studio's IDE. Not for practical reasons but for debugging reasons. If I want this project to be as
   bare metal as possible I must try my hardest to avoid <stdio.h>. This means avoiding _sprintf_.
   I am also not allowed to use _OutputDebugStringA_ without invoking the Visual Studio IDE since the
   program looks for _IsDebuggerPresent_ in order to call _OutputDebugStringA_.

1. I have decided that as this project build I would want the ReadMe to stay small and readable so I
   am moving the _Notes_ section here and making a small synopsis in replace of the original ReadMe.
   !!Notice!! the name of the file is DailyNotes as oppose to the typical Log.txt file.
   This is to distinguish the file from a future Debugging Log file generated by code.
   
2. I have added some code, which at the toggle of a few comments, will demo the use of CoInitializeEx.
